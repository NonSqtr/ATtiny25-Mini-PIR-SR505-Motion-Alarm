# ATtiny25-Mini-PIR-SR505-Motion-Alarm
Code to run on minimal resources. Includes a countdown sequence to allow PIR more than enough time to calibrate and also for the user to get out of the field of detection. Self-adjusting PIR sensors have a habit of getting stuck on HIGH if it is triggered during calibration. The countdown addresses this.
