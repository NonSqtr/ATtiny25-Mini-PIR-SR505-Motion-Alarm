# Attiny25-Mini-PIR-SR505-Motion-Alarm
Code to run on minimal resources. Includes a countdown sequence to allow PIR more than enough time to calibrate and also for the user to get out of the field of detection. Self-adjusting PIR sensors have a habit of getting stuck on HIGH if it senses detection during calibration. The countdown addresses this.

This is my first real code with loops and conditionals. I now have to get my head around the sleep function and interrupts.
